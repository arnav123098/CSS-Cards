        <strong>Structured Query Language (SQL)</strong> is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is essential for database management systems and is widely utilized in web development and data analysis.

SQL allows users to create, read, update, and delete data within a database. This capability facilitates the organization of data in a structured manner, making it easy to retrieve and manipulate information as needed. SQL commands can be executed to perform various tasks such as querying data, inserting new records, updating existing ones, and deleting unwanted data.

The language consists of various commands categorized into different types such as Data Query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL). These commands enable users to interact with the database effectively.

The name SQL reflects its structured approach to querying databases. The specifications for SQL are maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). SQL has become a fundamental skill for anyone working with databases and is supported by numerous database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
