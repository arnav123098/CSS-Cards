        <strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s changes.

Git tracks changes in source code during software development, enabling teams to collaborate effectively. It provides features like branching and merging, which allow developers to experiment with new ideas while keeping the main codebase stable. This flexibility is essential for modern software development practices.

The system is built around the concept of repositories, where all the project files and their history are stored. Each developer has a local copy of the repository, which allows for offline work and quick access to the full project history.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. Its popularity has led to widespread adoption across various industries and projects, making it a fundamental tool for developers today.
