        <strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and is primarily used for hosting and sharing code. It provides a collaborative environment for developers to work on projects together, track changes, and manage code repositories.

GitHub enables users to create repositories where they can store their projects, collaborate with others through pull requests, and maintain project documentation using Markdown. The platform supports various features such as issue tracking, project management boards, and continuous integration.

The service also allows for social networking among developers, making it easy to follow others, star repositories, and contribute to open-source projects. GitHub has become an essential tool in the software development industry, facilitating collaboration and enhancing productivity.

Founded in 2008, GitHub has grown to host millions of repositories and is widely recognized as the leading platform for version control and collaboration in software development.
