        <strong>Express.js</strong> is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies the development process by providing tools to manage routes, handle requests and responses, and integrate middleware.

Express.js allows developers to create server-side applications quickly by offering a straightforward API for defining routes and managing HTTP requests. It is designed to be unopinionated, meaning developers can structure their applications as they see fit while still benefiting from its powerful features.

The framework supports various templating engines that enable dynamic HTML generation and can be easily integrated with databases for data persistence. Its lightweight nature makes it suitable for both small projects and large-scale applications.

Since its release in 2010, Express.js has gained significant popularity within the Node.js community and is often used as the foundation for building RESTful APIs and single-page applications.
