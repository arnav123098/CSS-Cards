        <strong>Next.js</strong> is an open-source React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered applications with ease. It provides a robust set of features including static site generation, server-side rendering, and API routes that enhance the performance and scalability of web applications.

Next.js simplifies the process of building React applications by offering a file-based routing system and automatic code splitting. This means that developers can create pages by simply adding files to the pages directory without the need for complex configuration.

The framework also supports various rendering methods, allowing developers to choose between static generation and server-side rendering based on their application needs. This flexibility makes Next.js suitable for a wide range of use cases from simple static websites to complex web applications.

Since its release in 2016 by Vercel, Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks in the React ecosystem due to its developer-friendly features and strong community support.
